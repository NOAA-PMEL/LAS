Specify a holiday of:
  1*12:0:31:0:0:0*FW1             = New Year's Day
  fails.  Fix it.  Alan Burlison <Alan.Burlison@sun.com>

Add ParseRecur flag:
   WDn (n=1-7): Day n of the current week.

Jay Jacobs <jay@lach.net>
   Recurrences are broken slightly.  The way to calculate the Nth date
   is currently:
      D(N) = D(N-1) + O
   This leads to the following:
      D(0) = Jan 31
      O    = 1 month
      D(1) = Feb 28
      D(2) = Mar 28
      D(3) = Apr 28
   The desired dates would be Jan 31, Feb 28, Mar 31, Apr 30, ...
   To fix this, change the calculation to be:
      D(N) = D(0) + N*O

Make a &now function which returns the current time (so you don't
have to use a language-dependent word).

To Delta_Format, add %02Xv type formats, so that it is formatted to
2 characters wide with leading 0's, %2Xv is 2 characters wide with
leading spaces.  %3.1Xv handles decimal places.

Add Date_LocaleInit which calls Date_Init and then sets DateFormat
config varialbe.  Benjamin Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au>
   Essentially, I use POSIX::strftime to print a known date in the locale
   'native' format ('%x'), and parse the result to determine d/m/y, m/d/y,
   or y/m/d.
   
   Here's what I do for Date::Parse, perhaps for your module you could just
   substitute a default value for DateFormat:
   
   sub _dmorder
   # determine the "natural" day/month order for the current locale
   # - returns a sub which will expect two arguments (month, day) and
   #   return the arguments swapped as appropriate
   {  
	# %x - preferred (year, month, day) representation
	# - some examples: 1999-12-31, 31/12/99, 30.12.1999, 12/31/99
	my @d = (POSIX::strftime('%x', 0, 0, 0, 31, 12-1, 99) =~ 
		/(\d+)\D+(\d+)\D+(\d+)/);

	# check we got one each of "31", "12", and "[19]99" back
	$@ = "couldn't determine day,month order (got [@d])";
	warn("$@\n"), return sub { @_ } unless @d == 3;
	my %d;	$d{$1} = $d{$2} = $d{$3} = 1;
	warn("$@\n"), return sub { @_ } 
		unless ($d{31} and $d{12} and ($d{99} or $d{1999}));

	if ($1 == 31) { $@ = undef; return sub { ($_[1], $_[0]) } };	# d/m/y
	if ($2 == 31) { $@ = undef; return sub { ($_[0], $_[1]) } };	# m/d/y
	if ($3 == 31) { $@ = undef; return sub { ($_[0], $_[1]) } };	# y/m/d

	return sub { @_ };	# undetermined, use default
   }
   
   *dmorder = _dmorder();
   
   # and then later in Parse::Date, after month/day regexps (\d+/\d+)...
     - ($month, $day) = ($1, $2);    becomes...
     + ($month, $day) = dmorder($1, $2);


Make DateFormat variable handle y/m/d y/d/m m/d/y and d/m/y formats
in addition to m/d vs. d/m .  Also, make "%D" and "%x" UnixDate formats
use this variable.  Benjamin Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au>

Make `date` check `/bin/date`, etc., so that there is no reason to
have the ENV{PATH} = ... line.

In DateCalc, make a way to go:
  date + delta
  date - delta
  delta + delta
  delta - delta
  Steve Berlage <steve.berlage@entegee.com>

From jfh:
  /(a|b)/ evals 10 times slower than /a/ || /b/

Change UpdateCurrTZ to UpdateCurrTime and fix docs.  Paul Stone
  <paul@milestone.com>

Make sure there is a correspondance between:
  time,localtime,gmtime
  Date_SecsSince1970,Date_SecsSince1970GMT
  UnixDate(...,"%s"),UnixDate(...,"%u")
and document it all.

If TZ=XXX (where XXX is not known), report an error.  Aharon (Al) Schkolnik
   <aharon@deltathree.com>

As part of language initialization, store ALL ParseDateString regexps in
a hash (LangRE) in precompiled format.  Then, "require 5.005".

Support timezones of the format +500.  David Coppit <dwc3q@cs.virginia.edu>

Store the holiday desc/name as two lists instead of a hash so that the
order of parsing can be forced to be the same.

Use autoloader.  Ted Ashton <ashted@southern.edu>

Switch to Math::BigInt instead of using "no integer".  Vishal Bhatia
   <vishalb@hotmail.com>

Make sure that &DateCalc($date1,"") returns an error.  Jim Anderson
  <jander@ml.com>

Document that a number of seconds as a Delta should have "sec".  Otherwise
it'll likely get interpreted as YY, YYYY, YYYYMM, etc.  Disallow bare
numbers as deltas ?

If it can't determine the local timezone, set TZ to IGNORED ???

Add another INIT variable to NOT initialize any language variable unless
needed.

Add another internal format "xYYYYxMMxDDxHHxMNxSS" just to make sure
that NOTHING in Date::Manip is parsing the date itself.  Add a DateCalc
test using it (with the parsed dates including "next week Sunday" types
strings to test most routines).

Use of holidays and other named days in ParseDate ("Christmas 1995")
Abigal <abigail@fnx.com>

Change the Jan1Week1 variable to accept the values "m1-m7" (1st week contains
Jan X) or "d1-d7" (1st week contains the 1st dX day of week ... so d1
means that the 1st week of the year contains the 1st Monday).

Make work weeks able to start and stop on arbitrary days (even across
weekends).

Add the other ISO8601 stuff.

The only change needed to get it to work under 5.001 is to change the line:
   $file=cwd . "/$file"  if ($file !~ m|^/|);   # $file = "a/b/c"
to:
   $file=&getcwd . "/$file"  if ($file !~ m|^/|);   # $file = "a/b/c"
Since this also may eliminate a shell command (`pwd`), add a flag to
switch between the two.  Piran Montford <piran@cogapp.com>

Add 15/Oct/1997:07:56:43 (netscape log) suggested by:
 bugaj@dnrc.bell-labs.com  Stephan Vladimir Bugaj

Try to get rid of `date` in Date_TimeZone
Also, Cwd::cwd calls `pwd` (Bowen Dwelle) , but this may be inevitable.
If not, add a variable which will allow you to skip the sections where
   backticks are used since they are a performance sink.  Suggested by
   Bowen Dwelle.

Add
  Spanish
  German
  Italian
  Japanese (Kevin Baker will help)

Fill in some of the language variables ($past, $future, $zones).

Check French special characters.

Change EXPORT to EXPORT_OK (message 9 by Peter Bray)

Add ParseDateTemplate where a template containing any of the formats
from UnixDate may be used in a string (which may contain perl REs)
to parse a very strange date.

Mark Dedlow <dedlow@voro.lbl.gov>
  nth DAY of month
  nth WEEKDAY of month

Mark D. Anderson <mda@discerning.com>
  support for quarters (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec) as an extra
  sub-module
	recur returns first day (or business day) of the quarter
	42nd day of 3rd quarter
	what is current quarter

# TESTS
########################################################################

Add tests for all the new ParseDate formats to the test suite.

########################################################################
# GRANULARITY
########################################################################

$flag=&Date_GranularityTest($date,$base,$granularity [,$flags] [$width])
   $date and $base are dates
   $granularity and $width are deltas
   $flags is a list of flags

   To test if a day is one of every other Friday (starting at Friday
   Feb 7, 1997), go:
      $base=&ParseDate("Friday Feb 7 1997");
      $date=&ParseDate("...");
      $granularity=&ParseDateDelta("+ 2 weeks");
      $flag=&Date_Granularity($date,$base,$granularity,"exact");
   If $flag is 1, the $date is a 2nd Friday from Feb 7.

   The most important field in $granularity is the last non-zero element.
   In the above example, 2 weeks returns the delta 0:0:14:0:0:0 so the
   last non-zero element is days with a value of 14.

   If $flags is empty, $date is checked to see if it occurs some multiple
   of 14 days before or after $base.  In this case, hourse, minutes, and
   seconds are completely ignored.

   If $flags contains the words "before" or "after", $date must come
   before or after $base.

   If $flags contains any other options, or if $width is passed in, the
   test is treated in an approximate way.  A flag of "approx" forces this
   behavior.

   If $width is not passed in in an approximate comparison, it defaults
   to 1 in the last non-zero element.  Here, the default width is 1 day.
   If the flag "half" is used, the width (default or passed in) is
   halved.

   For example if $width is 1 day, add a multiple of $granularity to
   $base to get as close to $date as possible.  If $date is within plus
   or minus 1 day of this new base, the test is successful.  A flag of
   "plus" or "minus" means that $date must be with plus 1 day or within
   minus one day of this new base.  Flags of "before" or "after" work
   as well.

@list=&Date_GranularityList($date,$N,$granularity)
   Returns a list of $N dates AFTER $date which are created by adding
   $granularity to $date $N times.  If $N<0, it returns $N dates BEFORE
   $date (the list is in chronological order).

   Make it work in business mode as well which will return only working
   days.  Example, every other friday and it can be told that if friday
   falls on a holiday to return either thursday or the following monday
   or leave it out.

########################################################################
# DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME
########################################################################

Use zdump command to get timezone info.

If ignoring TIMEZONE info, treat all dates as in current timezone with
no d.s.t. effects (i.e. Jun 1 12:00 EDT == Jun 1 12:00 EST).

To do calculations, convert to current timezone (Jun 1 12:00 EDT -> Jun 1
11:00 EST even if that date doesn't really exist)

Determine zone pairings EST/EDT, PST/PDT for all zones.  Store EST#EDT in
$Date::Manip::TZ rather than just EST or EDT.  Make sure everything is
paired up.  Places with only a single timezone should work as well.

Make a 2nd hash where EST -> EST#EDT for all timezones.

Add an option to all date calculations to ignore daylight savings time
transitions.  Both normal/savings timezones are treated as identical to
the CURRENT timezone.  IgnoreSavingsTime=true

########################################################################
# TIMEZONES
########################################################################

Make date format:
  YYYYMMDDHH:MN:SS+HHMN*EST:EDT
where EST and EDT are the timezone abbreviations to use (this is set
when the date is parsed).  If these are not set, they default to the
timezones to use with +HHMN.

By default, convert all dates to current timezone however unless a
NOCONV option is set.

Add a Date_Compare to compare two dates (with timezone).

Modify all routines accordingly.

##SPEEDUPS

UpdateHolidays, don't use ParseDate to parse dates of form DD/MM or MM/DD.

In business mode date-date calculations, add a "quick" mode in which the
number of business days is estimated by:
    $date1 = &ParseDate("...");
    $date2 = &ParseDate("...");         # a 2nd date a long time after date1
    $delta = &DateCalc($date1,$date2);  # get an exact delta
    $days  = ( split(/:/,$delta) )[2];  # the number of days between the two
    $yrs   = $days/365.24;              # the number of years between the two
    $days  = $days*(5/7) - $yrs*9;
where 9 is the number of holidays in the year.  Add a variable to turn this
behavior off and another to tell what threshold to apply this to (by default
apply it to anything 2 months apart or more).  In this mode, only days are
returned, hours, minutes, seconds are ignored.
