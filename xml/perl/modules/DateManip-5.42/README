For information on installing Date::Manip, see the INSTALL file included in
the distribution.  For other documentation, see the Manip.pod file.

Please send questions or bug reports to me rather than posting them to
a newsgroup since I may miss them there, BUT read the next paragraph
before you automatically start firing off email to me!

If you have questions about Date::Manip, refer to the Date::Manip pod file.
Don't know what I'm talking about?  Read the perlpod man page.  Alternately,
an online version of the Date::Manip man page is included in my home page
given below.  PLEASE read the man page thoroughly before posting any questions
about Date::Manip to a newsgroup or emailing me.  If you've done this, I'll be
glad to answer any questions not covered or unclear in the man page.

** IMPORTANT NOTE (5.35) **

I am considering going OO... so everyone should use the appropriate
functions (UnixDate, Date_Cmp, Delta_Format) to extract information
from dates and deltas.  Any script which parses a date or delta as
a string will stop working when/if I make this change.  Even if I
don't, the internal format for both will change, so the above routines
should be used.


Notes for version 5.42:
   Mainly a bug fix release.
   Added Russian, Dutch, Turkish translations.
   Modified Delta_Format to treat the entire delta as exact if no month
      component is present.
   ***Fixed the problem of malformed UTF-8 character warnings.

All documentation is now contained in the Manip.pod file so I don't have
to keep it up-to-date in two places.
