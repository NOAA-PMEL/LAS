INTRODUCTION
------------
Greetings,

This file explains how to incorporate netCDFPerl, the perl extension for
netCDF dataset access, into perl 5.00? on a UNIX system.  (We're afraid
you're on your own for non-UNIX systems.)


PLATFORMS
---------
We've successfully incorporated netCDFPerl into perl 5.003 on the
following systems:

    Machine             Operating System        C Compiler

    DEC Alpha           Digital UNIX V4.0       /bin/cc
    DEC RISC            ULTRIX 4.5              /bin/cc
    HP 9000/715         HP_UX A.09.05           /bin/cc
    IBM rs6000          AIX 4.2                 /bin/cc
    Intel 586           Red Hat Linux 2.0.27    /usr/bin/cc
    SGI mips            IRIX 6.2                /bin/cc
    Sun sparc           SunOS 4.1.4             SC3.0.1/bin/acc
    Sun sparc           SunOS 5.5               SC4.2/bin/cc


PREREQUISITES
-------------
In order to incorporate netCDFPerl, you must already have version of 
perl 5.003 (or later) installed on your system.  Perl can be obtained from 
URL

    http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/perl5.html.

You should also have the netCDF package installed.  The version should
be 2.3.2, patch level 4, or later.  The netCDF package can be obtained
from URL

    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/

In order to be usable by a dynamically-linked netCDFPerl package, the
object modules in the netCDF library should have been compiled in a
position-independent manner, i.e. they should have been compiled as if
they were going to be put into a shared library (which they will be in a
dynamically-linked netCDFPerl module).  The following table gives some
of the relevant C compiler options that should have been used:

                    Operating System    Option

                    HP-UX               +z
                    SunOS 4.x           -pic
                    SunOS 5.x           -Kpic

On many other systems, generating position-independent code is
the default.  Check the manual page for your compiler for further
information.

If your system has perl4 or an early version of perl5 installed as well as
version 5.003, they must be moved before installing netCDFPerl because the 
netCDFPerl installation will use the old perl binaries.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
When you have the prerequisite perl 5.003 (or later) and netCDF packages
installed, then do the following to incorporate netCDFPerl:

    1.  Go to the directory containing this file (the top-level source
        directory of the NetCDFPerl package).

    2.  Set configuration variables, either in the environment or in the 
        file CUSTOMIZE.  In particular, the following variables might need
        values:

            Variable    Meaning
            --------    -------
            CPP_NETCDF  C compiler reference for the location of the
                        netCDF header file (e.g.
                        "-I/usr/local/include").

            LD_NETCDF   Linker reference for the location of the
                        netCDF library (e.g. "-L/usr/local/lib -lnetcdf").

            PERL        Pathname of the perl(1) utility.  If given, it
                        *must* refer to a perl 5 utility (and not a perl
                        4 one).

            PERL_MANDIR Pathname of the root of the directory hierarchy
                        that contains the perl manual pages (e.g.
                        "/usr/local/man").  The netCDFPerl(1) manual
                        page will be install under this directory.

    3.  Execute the "configure" script.  Redirect standard output and 
        standard error to the file "configure.log".  If an error message
        occurs in the output, then stop and send items A-E below to
        SUPPORT (see below).

        The configure script will look for your installed netCDF package
        and for your perl package.  If it can't find them, then it will
        tell you how to help it find them (via the variables mentioned
        above).

    4.  Execute the command "make perl/Makefile" to make the makefile in
        the perl/ subdirectory.  Redirect standard output and standard
        error to the file "makefile.log".  If an error occurs, then stop
        and send items A-F to SUPPORT (see below).

    5.  Modify the file perl/Makefile.PL if necessary:

        Because the netCDF header-file, "netcdf.h", is written in
        Standard C, it is necessary to use a Standard C compiler to
        build the NetCDFPerl extension module.  This can cause problems
        on systems whose perl(1) utility was not built using a Standard
        C compiler because the building of a perl(1) extension module is
        controlled by perl(1) (i.e. it is *not* under our control) and
        perl(1) insists on using the same compiler and options that were
        used to build it -- and if the compiler is non-standard, then
        the build of NetCDFPerl might fail.

        It is possible, however, to modify how perl(1) builds NetCDFPerl
        by modifying the file perl/Makefile.PL, which is created when
        the configure script is executed.  For example, on a SunOS
        4.1.4 system, we needed to use a Standard C compiler to compile
        NetCDFPerl, so we added the following entry to perl/Makefile.PL:

            'CC' => "acc",

        We also needed to reference the ANSI-C runtime-library because
        the netCDF library referred to it; so we changed the following
        entry

            'LIBS' => "-L/upc/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf",

        to

            'LIBS' => "-L/upc/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf -L/usr/lang/SC3.0.1/lib -lansi",

        You might have to do similar sorts of things -- depending on
        your system.  Look in the makefile "perl/Makefile" to see what
        variables you might add to or modify in "perl/Makefile.PL".

        IRIX64-6 Users: You must ensure that the same Application
        Binary Interface is used for the perl, netCDF, and netCDFPerl
        packages.

    6.  Execute "make".  Redirect standard output and standard error to
        the file "make.log".  If an error occurs, then stop and send items
        A-G to support (see below).

        This will build netCDFPerl in the perl/ subdirectory.  On
        systems that support shared libraries, a netCDFPerl shared
        library will be built.  On systems that lack shared library
        support, a new, statically-linked perl utility will be built
        that incorporates netCDFPerl as well as all previously
        incorporated extensions (e.g. TkPerl).

        NOTE: On a DEC RISC/ULTRIX 4.5 system, the perl-generated
        makefile "perl/Makefile" incorrectly believes that
        running the ranlib(1) utility on the created library
        perl/blib/auto/NetCDF/NetCDF.a is unnecessary.  Thus, the "make"
        will fail.  The workaround is to manually run ranlib(1) on the
        library man and then re-execute the "make".

    7.  Execute "make test".  Redirect standard output and standard
        error to the file "test.log".  If an error occurs, then stop and
        send items A-H to SUPPORT (see below).

        This will test netCDFPerl.  The perl script that executes the
        test is in perl/test.pl.  You might wish to peruse it as an
        example.

    8.  Execute "make install".  Redirect standard output and standard
        error to the file "install.log".  If an error occurs, then stop
        and send items A-I to SUPPORT (see below).
    
        This will incorporate netCDFPerl and its manual page into the
        perl installation.  To do this, you might need to be the user
        who originally installed perl.  NOTE: Currently, there is a bug
        in the perl/Makefile created by perl.  To correct the problem,
        edit the file perl/Makefile: on the line with "MOD_INSTALL"
        (near line 210) add "-I$(PERL_ARCHLIB)" before "-I$(PERL_LIB)".

    9.  Execute "make realclean".  This will remove all intermediate
        files, allowing you to incorporate netCDFPerl on another platform.
