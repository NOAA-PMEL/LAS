Release		Comments

1.2.3   2002-03-10

		Ported testing script "perl/test.pl" to perl v5.8.0.
		This should not have been necessary.

1.2.2	2002-01-09

		Ported to perl 5.005 and 5.6.0.

1.2.1	2000-07-25
		Improved "make install" with respect to installation of
		manual pages.

                Tried to clarify the fact that this extension-module is
                based on version 2 of the netCDF package.

		Added "POLLUTE=1" to the perl command that creates
		the makefile in the perl/ subdirectory to ensure
		compatibility with the new naming convensions of perl
		5.6.

1.2	1997-05-20
		Corrected manual page: fixed netcdf(3) reference so that
		man-cgi(1) will work with it.

                Ported to netCDF 3.  This required eliminating some
                netCDF C macros that should never have been in the
                public interface in the first place.  For example, I
                used NetCDF::RDWR in the test script "perl/test.pl"
                when I should have used NetCDF::NOWRITE.  Any perl
                script using these macros will have to be modified
                (fortunately, perl(1) reports undefined symbols).

                Improved INSTALL document: in particular, added
                commentary about modifying perl/Makefile.PL as
                necessary.

1.1	1996-08-22
		Allowed use of references for scalar output arguments.

                Documented lack of number-of-elements arguments in
                interface function and how to specify a scalar variable
                to NetCDF::vardef().

		Corrected configuration script so that setting of CC
		variable has an effect.

		Replaced use of croak() in perl/NetCDF.xs with warn().
		This will prevent the netCDF/Perl interface from
		aborting on error.

		Corrected typo in README file: changed `rcount' variable
		to `count'.

		Added check of NetCDF::attname() to perl `test' target.

		Slightly enhanced README.

		Added caveat about only using initialized output variables.

		Improved INSTALL file: added commentary about requiring
		position-independent netCDF object modules for a dynamic
		netCDFPerl module and listed desired information for
		diagnosing installation problems.

		Adapted perl/Makefile.PL.in to latest perl release.

1.0.4	1995-06-30
		Corrected names of netCDFPerl files in perl/MANIFEST file.

1.0.3	1995-06-29
		Fixed incorrect behavior of NetCDF::varput1().

		Converted top-level Makefile to POSIX.2 Standard.

1.0.2	1995-06-20
		Bug Fixes:
		    NetCDF::recget():
			First record was always returned regardless of
			requested record index.

		Documentation:
		    INSTALL File:
                        Reordered list of example, diagnostic commands
                        to be sent when a problem occurs and added `cat
                        VERSION`.

                        Added netCDF package to list of prerequisite
                        packages.

                        Added SunOS 5.4 to list systems on which
                        netCDFPerl has been successfully installed.

1.0.1	1995-06-12
		Added netCDFPerl URL to README.

		Fixed bug that caused a netCDF/perl record-variable size
		mismatch under SunOS 5 with the GNU C compiler.

		Fixed bug in NetCDF::getatt(): it used to crash the
		process.

1.0	1995-06-07
                Added CPP_NETCDF, LD_NETCDF, and LIBS examples to
		CUSTOMIZE file.

                Generalized netCDF::ncrecput and netCDF::ncrecget to
                allow references to scalar values.

		Added support for perl strings.  Reading a netCDF 
		character variable now returns a perl string rather than
		an array of integer values.

                Corrected bug in netCDF::ncattname: it would only
                return the first global attribute.  Thanks to Jon Meek
                <meekj@Cyanamid.COM>.

		Renamed everything in the API to conform to perl 5 
		conventions and to reduce redundancy:
		    *  The module name now starts with a capital;

                    *  Function names no longer contain an `nc' prefix;
		       and

                    *  Constant names no longer contain an `NC_'
		       substring.
		For example,
		    netCDF::nccreate($path, netCDF::NC_CLOBBER)
		is now
		    NetCDF::create($path, NetCDF::CLOBBER)

0.1	1995-05-23
		Ported installation mechanism to perl 5.001.

0.0	1995-05-15
		Initial release.
