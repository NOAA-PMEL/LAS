Greetings,

    This file briefly describes the netCDFPerl package.

INTRODUCTION
------------

    The netCDFPerl package is a perl extension for accessing netCDF
    datasets based on version 2 of the netCDF package (netCDF-2).  For
    example, the following netCDF-2 actions:

        1.  Open dataset "foo.nc";

        2.  Write a 2 x 3 array of double-precision values into the
        starting corner of the first variable; and

        3.  Close the dataset.

    can be accomplished by the following C fragment:

        int     ncid = ncopen("foo.nc", NC_WRITE);
        int     varid = 0;
        long    start[2], count[2];
        double  values[6];

        ncid = ncopen("foo.nc", NC_WRITE);

        start[0] = 0;
        start[1] = 0;
        count[0] = 2;
        count[1] = 3;

        values[0] = 0.0;
        values[1] = 1.0;
        values[2] = 2.0;
        values[3] = 3.0;
        values[4] = 4.0;
        values[5] = 5.0;

        ncvarput(ncid, varid, start, count, values);

        ncclose(ncid);

    or by this equivalent perl fragment:

        use NetCDF;

        $ncid = NetCDF::open("foo.nc", NetCDF::WRITE);
        $varid = 0;
        @start = (0, 0);
        @count = (2, 3);
        @values = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        NetCDF::varput($ncid, $varid, \@start, \@count, \@values);
        NetCDF::close($ncid);

    There are perl-callable functions for all appropriate functions of
    the netCDF-2 API.

netCDF-2 vs. netCDF-3
---------------------

    Currently, the NetCDFPerl extension module is implemented using
    version 2 of the netCDF API (netCDF-2).  On 1997-05-16, version 3
    of the netCDF package was released (netCDF-3).  This newer version,
    however, contains a netCDF-2 backward compatibility interface.
    Thus, with a few minor changes already made, NetCDFPerl works with
    netCDF-3 as well as netCDF-2.

    Users should be aware, however, that the NetCDFPerl user-interface
    is based on netCDF-2.  In particular, the NetCDFPerl documentation
    doesn't describe the NetCDFPerl interface in detail but instead
    describes the differences between it and the netCDF-2 interface.
    The intention was that users would use the NetCDFPerl and netCDF-2
    documentation together in order to program using NetCDFPerl.

    With the deprecation of the netCDF-2 interface, this has become
    slightly problematical -- but not unworkable.  The solution is to
    ensure the availability of the netCDF-2 documentation.  Currently,
    the netCDF version 2 User's Guide is available at the following URL:

	ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/guide-2.4.3.ps.Z

    and the netCDF-library manual page for netCDF-2 is available as the
    file "netcdf-2.4.3/src/doc/netcdf.3" in the netCDF-2 distribution at
    the following URL:

	ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-2.4.3.tar.Z


AVAILABILITY
------------

    netCDFPerl is freely available from either of the following URLs:

        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf-perl/
    
    or

        ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-perl/netcdf-perl.tar.Z

INSTALLATION
------------

    See the file INSTALL in the top-level directory of the netCDFPerl
    distribution for instructions on how to incorporate netCDFPerl into
    your perl utility.

    You will need write access to your installed perl(1) libraries in
    order to install netCDFPerl.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

    See the installed manual page, netCDFPerl(1), for additional
    information.

    There is a WWW page for netCDFPerl.  It's URL is

        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf-perl

MAILING-LIST
------------

    There is a netCDFPerl mailing-list.  To subscribe, send to the
    following address:

        majordomo@unidata.ucar.edu

    a message whose body consists solely of the following:

        subscribe netcdf-perl [opt-addr]

    where [opt-addr] is an optional email address -- if you use it, then
    mailing-list postings will be sent to it; otherwise, they will be
    sent to the return address of the subscription request.
