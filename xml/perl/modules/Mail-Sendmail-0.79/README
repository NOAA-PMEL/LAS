NAME
    Mail::Sendmail v. 0.79 - Simple platform independent mailer

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::Sendmail;

      %mail = ( To      => 'you@there.com',
                From    => 'me@here.com',
                Message => "This is a very short message"
               );

      sendmail(%mail) or die $Mail::Sendmail::error;

      print "OK. Log says:\n", $Mail::Sendmail::log;

DESCRIPTION
    Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script. Only requires
    Perl 5 and a network connection.

    Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which takes a hash with the
    message to send and sends it. It is intended to be very easy to setup
    and use. See also the section on "FEATURES" below.

INSTALLATION
    Best
        `perl -MCPAN -e "install Mail::Sendmail"'

    Traditional
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    Manual
        Copy Sendmail.pm to Mail/ in your Perl lib directory.

            (eg. c:\Perl\site\lib\Mail\
             or  /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/Mail/
             or whatever it is on your system.
             They are listed when you type C< perl -V >)

    ActivePerl's PPM
        ppm install --location=http://alma.ch/perl/ppm Mail-Sendmail

        But this way you don't get a chance to have a look at other files
        (Changes, Todo, test.pl, ...).

    At the top of Sendmail.pm, set your default SMTP server(s), unless you
    specify it with each message, or want to use the default (localhost).

    Install MIME::QuotedPrint. This is not required but strongly
    recommended.

FEATURES
    Automatic time zone detection, Date: header, MIME quoted-printable
    encoding (if MIME::QuotedPrint installed), all of which can be
    overridden.

    Bcc: and Cc: support.

    Allows real names in From:, To: and Cc: fields

    Doesn't send an X-Mailer: header (unless you do), and allows you to send
    any header(s) you want.

    Configurable retries and use of alternate servers if your mail server is
    down

    Good plain text error reporting

LIMITATIONS
    Headers are not encoded, even if they have accented characters.

    No suport for the SMTP AUTH extension.

    Since the whole message is in memory, it's not suitable for sending very
    big attached files.

    The SMTP server has to be set manually in Sendmail.pm or in your script,
    unless you have a mail server on localhost.

    Doesn't work on OpenVMS, I was told. Cannot test this myself.

CONFIGURATION
    Default SMTP server(s)
        This is probably all you want to configure. It is usually done
        through *$mailcfg{smtp}*, which you can edit at the top of the
        Sendmail.pm file. This is a reference to a list of SMTP servers. You
        can also set it from your script:

        `unshift @{$Mail::Sendmail::mailcfg{'smtp'}} , 'my.mail.server';'

        Alternatively, you can specify the server in the *%mail* hash you
        send from your script, which will do the same thing:

        `$mail{smtp} = 'my.mail.server';'

        A future version will (hopefully) try to set useful defaults for you
        during the Makefile.PL.

    Other configuration settings
        See *%mailcfg* under the section on "DETAILS" below for other
        configuration options.

DETAILS
  sendmail()

    sendmail is the only thing exported to your namespace by default

    `sendmail(%mail) || print "Error sending mail:
    $Mail::Sendmail::error\n";'

    It takes a hash containing the full message, with keys for all headers,
    body, and optionally for another non-default SMTP server and/or port.

    It returns 1 on success or 0 on error, and rewrites
    `$Mail::Sendmail::error' and `$Mail::Sendmail::log'.

    Keys are NOT case-sensitive.

    The colon after headers is not necessary.

    The Body part key can be called 'Body', 'Message' or 'Text'.

    The SMTP server key can be called 'Smtp' or 'Server'. If the connection
    to this one fails, the other ones in `$mailcfg{smtp}' will still be
    tried.

    The following headers are added unless you specify them yourself:

        Mime-Version: 1.0
        Content-Type: 'text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"'

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
        or (if MIME::QuotedPrint not installed)
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

        Date: [string returned by time_to_date()]

    If you wish to use an envelope sender address different than the From:
    address, set `$mail{Sender}' in your %mail hash.

    The following are not exported by default, but you can still access them
    with their full name, or request their export on the use line like in:
    `use Mail::Sendmail qw(sendmail $address_rx time_to_date);'

  Mail::Sendmail::time_to_date()

    convert time ( as from `time()' ) to an RFC 822 compliant string for the
    Date header. See also the section on "%Mail::Sendmail::mailcfg".

  $Mail::Sendmail::error

    When you don't run with the -w flag, the module sends no errors to
    STDERR, but puts anything it has to complain about in here. You should
    probably always check if it says something.

  $Mail::Sendmail::log

    A summary that you could write to a log file after each send

  $Mail::Sendmail::address_rx

    A handy regex to recognize e-mail addresses.

    A correct regex for valid e-mail addresses was written by one of the
    judges in the obfuscated Perl contest... :-) It is quite big. This one
    is an attempt to a reasonable compromise, and should accept all
    real-world internet style addresses. The domain part is required and
    comments or characters that would need to be quoted are not supported.

      Example:
        $rx = $Mail::Sendmail::address_rx;
        if (/$rx/) {
          $address=$1;
          $user=$2;
          $domain=$3;
        }

  %Mail::Sendmail::mailcfg

    This hash contains all configuration options. You normally edit it once
    (if ever) in Sendmail.pm and forget about it, but you could also access
    it from your scripts. For readability, I'll assume you have imported it
    (with something like `use Mail::Sendmail qw(sendmail %mailcfg)').

    The keys are not case-sensitive: they are all converted to lowercase
    before use. Writing `$mailcfg{Port} = 2525;' is OK: the default
    $mailcfg{port} (25) will be deleted and replaced with your new value of
    2525.

    $mailcfg{smtp}
        `$mailcfg{smtp} = [qw(localhost my.other.mail.server)];'

        This is a reference to a list of smtp servers, so if your main
        server is down, the module tries the next one. If one of your
        servers uses a special port, add it to the server name with a colon
        in front, to override the default port (like in
        my.special.server:2525).

        Default: localhost.

    $mailcfg{from}
        `$mailcfg{from} = 'Mailing script me@mydomain.com';'

        From address used if you don't supply one in your script. Should not
        be of type 'user@localhost' since that may not be valid on the
        recipient's host.

        Default: undefined.

    $mailcfg{mime}
        `$mailcfg{mime} = 1;'

        Set this to 0 if you don't want any automatic MIME encoding. You
        normally don't need this, the module should 'Do the right thing'
        anyway.

        Default: 1;

    $mailcfg{retries}
        `$mailcfg{retries} = 1;'

        How many times should the connection to the same SMTP server be
        retried in case of a failure.

        Default: 1;

    $mailcfg{delay}
        `$mailcfg{delay} = 1;'

        Number of seconds to wait between retries. This delay also happens
        before trying the next server in the list, if the retries for the
        current server have been exhausted. For CGI scripts, you want few
        retries and short delays to return with a results page before the
        http connection times out. For unattended scripts, you may want to
        use many retries and long delays to have a good chance of your mail
        being sent even with temporary failures on your network.

        Default: 1 (second);

    $mailcfg{tz}
        `$mailcfg{tz} = '+0800';'

        Normally, your time zone is set automatically, from the difference
        between `time()' and `gmtime()'. This allows you to override
        automatic detection in cases where your system is confused (such as
        some Win32 systems in zones which do not use daylight savings time:
        see Microsoft KB article Q148681)

        Default: undefined (automatic detection at run-time).

    $mailcfg{port}
        `$mailcfg{port} = 25;'

        Port used when none is specified in the server name.

        Default: 25.

    $mailcfg{debug}
        `$mailcfg{debug} = 0;'

        Prints stuff to STDERR. Current maximum is 6, which prints the whole
        SMTP session, except data exceeding 500 bytes.

        Default: 0;

  $Mail::Sendmail::VERSION

    The package version number (you can not import this one)

  Configuration variables from previous versions

    The following global variables were used in version 0.74 for
    configuration. As from version 0.78_1, they are not supported anymore.
    Use the *%mailcfg* hash if you need to access the configuration from
    your scripts.

    $Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_server
    $Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_port
    $Mail::Sendmail::default_sender
    $Mail::Sendmail::TZ
    $Mail::Sendmail::connect_retries
    $Mail::Sendmail::retry_delay
    $Mail::Sendmail::use_MIME
ANOTHER EXAMPLE
      use Mail::Sendmail;

      print "Testing Mail::Sendmail version $Mail::Sendmail::VERSION\n";
      print "Default server: $Mail::Sendmail::mailcfg{smtp}->[0]\n";
      print "Default sender: $Mail::Sendmail::mailcfg{from}\n";

      %mail = (
          #To      => 'No to field this time, only Bcc and Cc',
          #From    => 'not needed, use default',
          Bcc     => 'Someone <him@there.com>, Someone else her@there.com',
          # only addresses are extracted from Bcc, real names disregarded
          Cc      => 'Yet someone else <xz@whatever.com>',
          # Cc will appear in the header. (Bcc will not)
          Subject => 'Test message',
          'X-Mailer' => "Mail::Sendmail version $Mail::Sendmail::VERSION",
      );

      $mail{Smtp} = 'special_server.for-this-message-only.domain.com';
      $mail{'X-custom'} = 'My custom additionnal header';
      $mail{'mESSaGE : '} = "The message key looks terrible, but works.";
      # cheat on the date:
      $mail{Date} = Mail::Sendmail::time_to_date( time() - 86400 );

      if (sendmail %mail) { print "Mail sent OK.\n" }
      else { print "Error sending mail: $Mail::Sendmail::error \n" }

      print "\n\$Mail::Sendmail::log says:\n", $Mail::Sendmail::log;

    mail and sending attachments.

CHANGES
    Main changes since version 0.78:

    Added "/" (\x2F) as a valid character in mailbox part.

    Removed old configuration variables which are not used anymore since
    version 0.74.

    Added support for different envelope sender (through `$mail{Sender}')

    Changed case of headers: first character after "-" also uppercased

    Support for multi-line server responses

    Localized $\ and $_

    Some internal rewrites and documentation updates

    Fixed old bug of dot as 76th character on line disappearing.

    Fixed very old bug where port number was not extracted from stuff like
    'my.server:2525'.

    Fixed time_to_date bug with negative half-hour zones (only
    Newfoundland?)

    Added seconds to date string

    Now uses Sys::Hostname to get the hostname for HELO. (This may break the
    module on some very old Win32 Perls where Sys::Hostname was broken)

    Enable full session output for debugging

    See the Changes file for the full history. If you don't have it because
    you installed through PPM, you can also find the latest one on
    http://alma.ch/perl/scripts/Sendmail/Changes.

NOTES
    MIME::QuotedPrint is used by default on every message if available. It
    allows reliable sending of accented characters, and also takes care of
    too long lines (which can happen in HTML mails). It is available in the
    MIME-Base64 package at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MIME/
    or through PPM.

    Look at http://alma.ch/perl/Mail-Sendmail-FAQ.html for additional info
    (CGI, examples of sending attachments, HTML mail etc...)

    You can use this module freely. (Someone complained this is too vague.
    So, more precisely: do whatever you want with it, but be warned that
    terrible things will happen to you if you use it badly, like for sending
    spam, or ...?)

    Thanks to the many users who sent me feedback, bug reports, suggestions,
    etc. And please excuse me if I forgot to answer your mail. I am not
    always reliabe in answering mail. I intend to set up a mailing list
    soon.
