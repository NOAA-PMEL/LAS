=head1 NAME

Log::Agent::File::Native - low-overhead IO::File

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 require Log::Agent::File::Native;

 my $fh = Log::Agent::File::Native->make(\*main::STDERR);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a stripped down implementation of IO::File, to avoid using
the IO::* hierarchy which does not work properly for my simple needs.

=over 4

=item make I<glob>

This is the creation routine. Encapsulates the I<glob> reference so that
we can use object-oriented calls on it.

=item print I<args>

Prints I<args> to the file.
