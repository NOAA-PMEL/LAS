<h1>Using catalogCleaner.sh</h1>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><em>The catalogCleaner attempts to search through massive THREDDS catalogs 
    and find collections of OPeNDAP URLs which contain grids suitable for use 
    with LAS.</em></b><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Running the Cleaner<br />
</h3>
<p>The script takes four command line arguments:</p>
<p>bin/catalogCleaner.sh /home/rhs/workspace/baker/toclean.xml true catalogs server</p>
<h3>Argument One (the file name of the server-side catalog or the URL of the client 
  catalog to read)</h3>
<p>This is either a local server-side configuration catalog or a remote client 
  catalog URL.<br />
</p>
<h3>Argument Two (aggregations: true|false)<br />
</h3>
<p>The second controls whether the cleaner attempts to create aggregations when 
  it finds collections of unaggregated OPeNDAP accessible dataset. If set to true, 
  the ncML will be build and placed in the output catalog. If set to false, the 
  need for aggregation will be noted in a property (&lt;property name="aggregationNeeded" 
  value="true"/&gt; for the parent data set and the individual OPeNDAP accessible 
  URLs will not be included.</p>
<h3>Argument Three (output type: catalogs|dataset)<br />
</h3>
<p>The third argument controls the type of output in the resulting "clean" catalog. 
  If the value is set to "catalogs" collections of OPeNDAP accessible URLs that 
  don't need aggregation and contain lat/lon grids will be put into the clean 
  catalogs as &lt;catalogRef&gt; elements pointing to the container dataset. If 
  the value is set to "datasets" each individual OPeNDAP accessible data set URL 
  which contains a grid will be listed in the output catalog. The advantage of 
  this is that the catalog will be strictly "clean". The advantage of the other 
  is that changes (particularly additions) in the remote catalog will show up 
  in any server that is serving the "clean" catalog.</p>
<h3>Argument Four (input type: server|client)<br />
</h3>
<p>The final argument tells the cleaner software what type of catalog is being 
  read. If the value is "server" then the server expects a simple catalog with 
  many &lt;catalogRef&gt; elements. If the value is "client" then it expects to 
  see a remote client catalog.</p>
<p>In the server case, the cleaner treats each catalogRef separately and will 
  produce a separate "clean" catalog for each. I will also rewrite the input catalog 
  to refer to the new clean catalogs. Additionally, the action performed on each 
  catalogRef can be controlled with properties. For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br />&lt;catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="GEO-IDE Thredds server" version="1.0.1"&gt;<br />&lt;catalogRef xlink:title="ggg" xlink:href="http://oceanwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.xml"&gt;<br />    &lt;property name="stop" value="Aqua MODIS, NPP, Pacific Ocean"/&gt;<br />    &lt;property name="skip" value="PaCOOS"/&gt;<br />&lt;/catalogRef&gt;<br />&lt;/catalog&gt;<br /></pre>
<p>The cleaner understand two types of properties. The one called stop will cause 
  the cleaner to stop processing a catalog when it reaches a member data set which 
  contains the text in the value attribute in its name. This is a strict sub-string 
  match. (Regular expression could be added if needed). Only one stop properlty 
  is allowed. If more than one are listed then the cleaner uses the last one it 
  finds.</p>
<p>The skip property causes the cleaner to skip data sets which have the text 
  in the value in their name. This is a strict sub-string match. (Regular expression 
  could be added if needed). More than one skip property is allowed.</p>
<p>In the client case, the cleaner just processes the entire catalog as best it 
  can.<br />
</p>
<p>Obviously, if you are attempting to clean a complicated catalog as a client, 
  you can simply build a small server-side catalog like the one above and use 
  it to control the processing of the client catalog.</p>
<p>There are constants in the CatalogCleaner class which control how many files 
  get checked. We could move those to properties if that would help.<br />
