! Extracting to a netCDF file and some text and table files have different
! options in the UI.  Need to separate them at this level to keep the UI
! happy.  All the Data_Extract* scripts launch the same list_data.jnl script.
!
! The format symbol is called data_format in the options file.  Don't know why.  Rather than mess
! with figuring out if it affects the old ui, just assign it here. The data_format will be one of 
! one of "tsv" "csv" "asc".

IF ($ferret_data_format_format"0|*>1") THEN DEFINE SYMBOL ferret_data_format = ($ferret_data_format_format)
DEFINE SYMBOL ferret_format = asc
GO list_data
