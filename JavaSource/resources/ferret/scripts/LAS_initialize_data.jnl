!
! The LAS_initialize_data.jnl script takes care of everything having to
! do with initializing a datset for later use.
!
! LAS_initialize_data.jnl takes an argument that specifies which data
! item [0|1|2|3|...] to create symbols for. 
!
! 3/2007:
! split up previous version of LAS_initialize_data.jnl into two;
! initialize the dataset and define the plot (or output listing) variable.
! This allows the custom init scripts to call LAS_initialize_dataset, then
! issue commands for the customization, then call LAS_initialize_variable
!
! 8/2007:
! The custom init scripts now consist of only SET DATA and the custom commands.
! This lets F-TDS run first and call the init script to create the data set
! that will be used by the Ferret product script. When F-TDS is done it will 
! not send the symbol ferret_init_script to the product scripts so we will just skip
! that step.
!
! 8/2007:
! Some of the custom init scripts previously contained commands like SET MEMORY
! or SET MODE which are intended to be executed by the product script These need
! to be separated from commands for fixing grids or regridding which are executed
! prior to the product script being run by F-TDS. These commands are to be specified
! in the dataset configuration as ferret_init_commands, whose the value is a set
! of Ferret commands separated by semicolons.
