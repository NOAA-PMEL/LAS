This package implements the netCDF Java IO Service Provider Interface using external invocations of the Ferret display and analysis
package to read and manipulate data.  Plugging the Ferret IOSP into the THREDDS Data Server (TDS) allows TDS to serve virtual data variables
that are defined within a Ferret script to be served just as if the variables were contained in a netCDF file.
