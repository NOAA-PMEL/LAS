The OLMapWidget is a a wrapper for the OpenLayers which adds widgets that
allow a click, hold and drag, selection of latitude/longitude rectangles, latitude lines, longitude lines and points
while displaying an overlay on the map showing the selected area.  The lines and rectangles
allow the item to be selected and for the selection to be edited by moving the handles.  The map
includes text widgets which display the N and S latitude, and E and W longitude of the 
current selection and allow for user entry of values to edit the selection.  The map includes
a reset button to zoom to the current valid data region.  
<p>
We use this widget a part of a tool kit that makes server requests based on the map selections.  We expect you will want to use 
this widget as part of a client that will use the selection, but you can
implement a listener in the class that has your OnModuleLoad and use this widget it to pan and zoom to the selection to mimic the behavior of
other drag and zoom implementations available in the native JavaScript map.
