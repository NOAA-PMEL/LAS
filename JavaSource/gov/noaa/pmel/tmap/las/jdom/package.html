This package contains all of the code needed to interact with the LAS configuration files that makes up the bulk of the "model" portion of the MVC architecture of LAS.
Each configuration file is represented by a class that is a sub-class of the LASDocument class which is in turn a sub-class of the JDOM Document class.  The 
most complex class is the LASConfig class which represents the contents of las.xml and all of the entities it references.  In order to keep the Model code 
separate from the Web framework (the controller) all interactions with the configuration should take place via methods in this package.
