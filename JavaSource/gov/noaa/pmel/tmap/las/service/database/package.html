This package implements a database backend Web service for LAS.  The web service must implement
a single method that takes in a single String argument (an XML LAS Backend Request Document as a string)
and returns a single String argument (an LAS Backend Response document as a String).

A backend service should also implement a "cancel" mechanism where an identical request
for the same product with the addition of a &lt;cancel&gt; element below the root of the
request will cause any pending or running requests for that same product to be terminated.

This is implemented as an Apache Axis 1.X SOAP Web service.
