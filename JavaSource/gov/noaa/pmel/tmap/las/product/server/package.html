This package implements the controller framework (currently a single Struts Action class) that
is responsible for taking in client LAS requests, utilizing the services need to create the
requested product, assembling the product (if requested) and returning the product to the 
requesting client.

The webapp http://host:port/baker/ProductServer.do takes a single query string argument
(with a parameter name "xml") which is the encoded XML User Interface request for the product that the
client wants created.

If the URL is invoked with no query string arguments, it produces a small summary of
itself (more links should be added to the report to facilitate distributing the configuration and query
parameters to dump the config information should also be added).
