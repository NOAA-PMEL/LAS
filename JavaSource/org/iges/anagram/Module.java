 *  Each module encapsulates a portion of the server's functionality.<p>
 *  
 *  Modules are distinct from other Anagram classes in that they:
 *  <list>
 *    <li>have an ID, and a complete name based on 
 *        their parents in the module hierarchy </li>
 *    <li>support a standard initialization and configuration interface</li>
 *    <li>are provided with a reference to to the top-level module 
 *        (the Server object) and thus can access all other public
 *        modules in the hierarchy</li>
 *    <li>must be threadsafe (with the exception of the init() and 
 *       configure() methods)</li>
 *  </list>
