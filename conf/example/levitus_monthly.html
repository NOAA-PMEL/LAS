        Levitus (1982) Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean

Grid: global, 1x1 degree; 19 levels from surface to 1000 m, monthly climatology.
Author: Sydney Levitus

     This data set is the monthly climatology prepared by Sydney Levitus
and published in 1982, of world ocean temperature.

The following is from the reference below.

     This atlas represents a synthesis of all temperature, salinity and oxygen
data available from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).  These
parameters have been analyzed in a consistent, objective manner at standard
oceanographic analysis levels on a one-degree latitude-longitude grid between
the surface and ocean bottom with a maximum depth of 5500 m.  
     The analyses and statistical information presented are intended primarily
for use in the study of the role of the oceans in controlling the earth's
climate, but they can be used for other scientific investigations also.  The
objective analyses shown in this atlas have certain limitations owing to the
nature of the data base (non-synoptic, scattered in space) and to the
characteristics of the objective analysis techniques and the particular grid
which we used.  These limitations and characteristics are discussed in the
text.  The analyses presented are viewed as another tool for studying the
world ocean.  Preliminary results have been used in a variety of ways.
