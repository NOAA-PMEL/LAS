This is the pure Java implementation of the TMAP Live Access Server.  There are three major components to this implementation of LAS, <a href="#LPS">the Product Server</a>, <a href="#LBES">a
collection of backend services</a> and the <a href="#LUIS">user interface server</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="LPS"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Product Server</span><br>
<br>
The LAS Product Server (LPS) is implemented as a Struts-based Web
application server (though care has been taken to keep the logic that
deals with LAS configuration files and the request and response
messages separate from the framework). The LPS typically does
work on behalf of an LAS User Interface (LUI) server, a servlet-based
Web application server responsible for presenting HTML pages to a
browser from which the user interacts with an LAS site. When the
user has completed the selections necessary to create an LAS Product,
the LUI redirects the browser to an LPS URL. The query string of
this URL contains one essential parameter (a text parameter named "xml"
which is a string representation of the UI Request XML [some outdated
documentation about these messages is available here:
http://www.ferret.noaa.gov/Ferret/LAS/Documentation/manual/reqapi.html).
The user interface model we use is for the LPS URL to be opened in a
new "output" window of the user's browser. This window
accumulates LPS URLs in its history and interacts with the LPS to give
the user feedback from long-running product requests, gives the user
the ability to cancel long-running product requests and has the
potential to make subsequent requests directly to the LPS. The
remainder of this document will deal exclusively to what happens after
the request has been received by the LPS.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Life-cycle of a Request</span><br>
<br>
The life-cycle of a LAS UI Request from its arrival at the LPS is as
follows. Using the UI Request and the LAS configuration, the LPS
(a Struts Action class called ProductServerAction) creates a
ProductRequest object. Using the newly constructed ProductRequest
object along with the LAS configuration (which has been processed when
the servlet initialized to merge the hierarchy of &lt;property&gt;
definitions), the LPS specific configuration (information about the
cache and the known backend services), the incoming HTTP Request
object, the Structs action mapping (this is unnecessary and will be
eliminated to separate the "Runner" thread from the Struts framework)
and a reference to the centrally maintained cache object, the LPS
constructs a ProductServerRunner object (which is a sub-class of Java
Thread). The Thread is started and the LPS joins this thread and
waits for it complete. If it completes the request or encounters
an error within the &lt;ui_timeout&gt; it returns the product or error
to the client. If the Thread has not finished before the
specified &lt;ui_timeout&gt; this Thread object is stored as an
attribute in the Struts ActionServlet context and the LPS returns a
progress page to the client (with information about how many times the
progress page has refreshed since the request started and which step in
the compound operation is currently being performed). After a 5
second delay, the browser client refreshes by sending the exact same
request to the LPS. The LPS takes the UI Request and finds the
Thread in its context that is processing this request. It joins
that Thread and again waits for the &lt;ui_timeout&gt; to expire or the
request to complete repeating the cycle of sending the progress page
and refreshing the browser with the same request. Eventually, the
ProductServerRunner will complete or the Backend Service will encounter
the &lt;product_timeout&gt; and return a timeout error.<br>
<br>
In the event that no &lt;ui_timeout&gt; is set in the incoming request
(such as with a "batch" request from a command line client) the LPS
will wait forever for the ProdcutServerRunner thread to complete
without returning a progress page.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How the LPS Uses the LAS Configuration</span><br>
<br>
The complexity of the operations and the mechanics of the data access
necessary to make a product are hidden from the LUI by abstractions
contained in XML configuration documents. For example, the
configuration will contain details such as the units, time, geographic
extents a particular data variable. The fact that these data
reside on a remote OPeNDAP server or in a database table is hidden from
the LUI. Likewise, the fact that creating the particular graphic
product request might require the LPS to request that information be
extracted from a database table and an intermediate netCDF file be
created and then request a plot be made from this file is also hidden
from the LUI.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it is a large part of the job of the LPS to unwind these
hidden complexities into the specific steps needed to create the
product. It is not however, the job of the LPS to create the
intermediate and final products needed to fulfill the request.
Instead, the LPS will call upon one or more Backend Services to build
the products necessary to complete a request. We have implemented
a collection of Backend Services which we deploy in the LAS Backend
Server (LBES). The LBES is nothing more than the Apache
AxisServlet with a collection of LAS specific services deployed to the
AxisServlet via the Axis WSDL.<br>
<br>
In order to make the translation from the abstract references to data
and operations included in the UI request to specific data access
mechanisms and backend services, the LPS translates the UI request into
an internal data structure called a ProductRequest. This
translation highlights one of the first and most important design
philosophies of the LPS architecture, the use of Plain Ordinary Java
Objects (POJOs) to hold the application specific data.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The ProductRequest POJO[<a href="#pojo">2</a>]
(a marriage between the UI Request and the LAS Configuration)</span><br>
<br>
The constructor for the ProductRequest object takes as input the JDOM
Document representing the LAS Configuration information and the JDOM
Document representing UI Request XML. (Actually, all of the XML
in the LPS and LBES are internally represented by sub-classes of
LASDocument which is in turn a sub-class of JDOM Docment.) The
ProductRequest object is independent of the Web application framework
that is used to deploy the application. This means the JUnit
testing can be used to exercise all of the code that creates and
manipulates the ProductReqeust object and most importantly the
underlying Web application framework can be changed without affecting a
single line of the ProductReqeust object's code. The biggest
collection of information in the ProductRequest object is an
ArrayList&lt;LASBackendRequest&gt; which contains the XML documents
that will used to invoke each backend service (some preliminary
information about the LASBackendRequest XML document can be found here:
http://tmap.pmel.noaa.gov/~rhs/JPS/LBES.html). When this XML is
constructed all of the abstractions which point to data definitions in
the LAS configuration are resolved into actual data access information
either in form of file names or network resources (such as OPeNDAP
URLs). Additionally, all of the property definitions which are
contained in the LAS configuration XML are included in the XML that
defines the data access for each LAS variable include in the
request. Finally, this XML also contains concrete file names
which will be the containers for the results this operation is expected
to produce (plot images, map scale information, debug output and so
on). The construction of the ProductRequest object is also
responsible for creating the connections between compound operations
where the results from one operation are used as input into subsequent
operations. <br>
The ProductActionRunner (the POJO that invokes the backend services)<br>
<br>
When the ProductRequest object has been constructed, it is in turn used
to construct the ProductServerRunner, the Thread sub-class that will be
run to create the product. The ProductServerRunner Thread runs
and sequentially invokes the services necessary to create the requested
product and collates the responses.<br>
Cache Mangement<br>
<br>
All of the cache management occurs at the LPS before any backend
services are invoked. The first check for a cache hit is based on
the cached key generated from the UI Request. If there is a
response file in the cache that matches this key, that response file is
examined to make sure all of the individual results are still in the
cache. If so, then the LPS returns this response
immediately. If not it begins the process of invoking the
individual services needed to produce the final product. Each
individual sub-operation and its response are also cached so based on
cache keys generated from the Backend Request XML for each
sub-operation.<br>
<br>
Individual backend service implementations are also welcome to manage a
cache independently of the LPS, but are not required to do so.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Backend Services (and how they are
invoked and controlled)</span><br>
<br>
The second important design philosophy has to do with the fact that the
actions of the Backend Services that ultimately fulfill the product
requests can be controlled by the LAS configuration. For the two
services that we have implemented so far, this behavior is achieved by
assigning a script template to each LAS operation.<br>
<br>
For example, in the implementation of the Ferret backend service an
operation that will perform a plot in a 2D plane is defined with this
XML:<br>
<br>
&lt;operation name="2D Plot" ID="Plot_2D" template="output"
script="Plot_2D"&gt;<br>

&lt;service&gt;ferret&lt;/service&gt;<br>
 &lt;args&gt;<br>
<br>

&lt;!-- This can now be improved with min/max info<br>
<br>

to be used by the UI to enforce selections. --&gt;<br>

&lt;arg type="variable" index="1" /&gt;<br>

&lt;arg type="region" index="1" /&gt;<br>
 &lt;/args&gt;<br>
 &lt;response
ID="PlotResp" type="HTML" index="1"&gt;<br>

&lt;result type="image" ID="image1" /&gt;<br>

&lt;result type="image" ID="ref_map" /&gt;<br>

&lt;result type="map_scale" ID="map_scale" /&gt;<br>

&lt;result type="debug" ID="debug" /&gt;<br>

&lt;result type="cancel" ID="cancel" /&gt;<br>
 &lt;/response&gt;<br>
 &lt;/operation&gt;<br>
<br>
The ProductServerRunner takes the ProductRequest and begins invoking
the service for each LASBackendRequest. The SOAP call to the
service is invoked and the LASBackendReqeust is passed to the backend
service as a single String argument. The "script" attribute
of this operation definition is a reference to a particular text file
in the resource path of the backend service. When the backend
service (named in the &lt;service&gt; element of the operation
definition) receives this request, it will process this template as
part of fulfilling the request (see below).<br>
<br>
<a name="LBES"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Backend Services</span><br>
<br>
At this point, we are ready to hop across the network to the backend
services that are needed to create the product. Each of the
backend services that we have implemented has the same basic
structure. The service is a simple class which exposes a single
method to the SOAP clients and this method accepts the
LASBackendRequest XML string as its only argument. This request
object is used to construct a Tool[1] class (which extends a generic
Tool class). The Tool class must implement a run method which
processes the request. If the Tool needs to interface with a
legacy application such as Ferret a generic Task class is available
which contains all of the infrastructure needed to run the external
Unix application (methods for constructing the Runtime class to
interface with the operating system, methods to pick up the output
streams (which is critical since process can block with buffer
overflows if this is not done correctly) and a generic methods to
search the output streams for error conditions). I have used this
Task class to run Ferret and to run Perl scripts.<br>
<br>
When the service runs the aforementioned "script" file is what controls
the actions of the legacy application or database query. This
file is first processed as a Velocity template with the
LASBackendRequest object in its context. All of the LAS
configuration properties (that apply to this request or to the data
variables referenced by this request) and names of input and output
data files are available from the LASBackendRequest object and can
thereby be translated into Ferret symbols or placed into SQL requests
to customize the action for this particular request.<br>
<br>
The backend service processes the request (runs the ferret or queries
the db based on the "script") and constructs and LASBackendResponse
object that will be returned to the LPS. This is a very simple
XML construct that contains the names and IDs of the output files
produced. (If the backend service is a remote service it must
return a network URL instead of a file path in the response XML).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Canceling a Request</span><br>
<br>
The backend service must also be prepared to handle a request to cancel
a running request. If the LPS sends exactly the same request
again (except containing a single &lt;cancel/&gt; element below the
root element) the backend service should stop processing the
request. Since getting access to the thread processing the
backend request in the AxisServlet is complicated, we have implemented
this action using the file system to signal that the request has been
canceled. When the cancel request arrives the backend service
creates an empty "cancel" file (defined in the operation XML) and
immediately returns an error response indicating that the job has been
canceled (even though the thread running the backend service may or may
not have stopped processing the request at that moment).
This means that the LPS can halt the ProductServerRunner that is
processing the job and signal the user that the job has been
canceled. Meanwhile, the original thread that is processing the
job on the backend should be checking periodically (after completing
various steps along the way in the Tool and Task classes) for the
existence of the "cancel" file. If it finds the file it can stop
processing and it has no further responsibilities and does not need to
return any information to the LPS since the request that caused the
cancel file to be created has already taken care of signaling the LPS
and user that the job has been canceled.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Error Processing</span><br>
<br>
If the backend service encounters an error processing the request it
constructs a special LASBackendResponse with the error information
included and the LPS will detect the error and forward to the generic
error response (shown in the diagram below).<br>
Processing the Response<br>
<br>
We are now ready to return to the LSP. The LASBackendResponse is
shipped back the ProductServerRunner (as a string) and the
ProductServerRunner invokes the next service in the chain or signals
the ProductServerAction that it is finished. The final task of
the ProductActionServer is to process the response it receives.
In any case, it removes the ProductActionRunner object from the Servlet
context (at that moment subsequent requests for the same product will
either get their request fulfilled from cache or will cause the product
to be regenerated). If the response contains an error the action
is forwarded to the error template which displays the error to the
user. Otherwise, if the cache is turned on the LASBackendResponse
file is added to the cache and the action is forwarded to the output
template.<br>
<br>
This last bit of work is the final part of the design philosophy in the
new architecture. Every operation can have a template assigned to
it which tells the LPS how to display the results. The template
has access to the LASBackendResponse object and from this object it can
extract any or all of the results that are defined in the response (be
they debug text, plot output, ASCII data files and so on). It
also has access to the LASUIRequest that was used to create this
product so that it can make decisions about what to display, fill in
titles and other information based on the values of properties that are
defined for this request.<br>
<br>
Finally, to allow the LPS to cause the browser to invoke external
applications (such as Excel with CSV files) or to allow LPS URLs to
used as the src attribute in &lt;img&gt; HTML tags, the LPS operations
XML allows for operations to be defined with a single streaming
result. E.g.<br>
<br>
&lt;result type="image" ID="plot_image" stream="true"
mime_type="image/jpg"/&gt;<br>
<br>
If the LPS processes a request for an operation that asks for the
output to be streamed, it sets the mime type of the response, picks up
the bytes of the output and streams them back to the client then
signals the Struts action servlet that is finished by forwarding to a
null action.<br>
